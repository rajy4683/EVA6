# Simple Neural Network in Excel

## Objective
We explore the following functionalities of a simple Neural network that has 2 weights:

1. Forward Propagation and predicted result
2. Calculated loss (Mean Squared Error) against the actual values
3. Calculate gradients across each layer of weights with respect to the loss
4. Perform weight update for each of the layer based on the calculated gradients
5. Repeat the procedure for multiple iterations and observe the loss
5. We use multiple **learning rate** parameters to check the impact on the overall loss.

The neural network consists of 2 layers with each layer having 2 weights and there are 2 inputs to the network. The network is shown below:
